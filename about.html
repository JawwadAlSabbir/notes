My name is Saurabh Maurya, and I am from Chandauli, Uttar Pradesh. I am doing Electronics Engineering from IIT BHU. My technical skills include programming in C, C++ and Python, and I am also familiar with web development, machine learning, competitive programming, data structures and algorithms, Image processing etc. I have also used these skills to build several projects which can be seen in my <a href="https://srbmaury.github.io/Portfolio_Website/" target="_new">Portfolio Website</a>. Coming to my extracurricular activities, I have worked with the Student Counseling Services team of IIT BHU to teach the essential points related to the CY101 course and clear their doubts before their mid-semester end-semester exams. I have also worked with the External Affairs team of Udyam, which is the departmental fest of Electronics Engineering IIT BHU.
